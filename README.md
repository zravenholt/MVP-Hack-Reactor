# MVP-Hack-Reactor
MVP project completed over two days for Hack Reactor

Project Name:

new Buddy()



Description:

Hack Reactor students can use this to keep track of their previous coding partners, 
and who is still available to partner with from their cohort.



Summary:

Much of Hack Reactor's learning is done with a partner. For the first 6 weeks of the bootcamp 
students pair with another new student every 2 days. This learning style is designed to imitate 
future working conditions, where coders are expected to be able to work with a wide range of individuals.

With the fast pace and intense requirements to complete, students shouldn't have to worry about
remembering which individuals they have partnered with. With "new Buddy()", they can easily keep track of 
those they have already partnered with, and select a new partner from the field of viable students.

"It's easy to make a new friend, and even easier to find one with new Buddy()!"







To get started, clone this repo and set up the database. Add new students to it, and when they log in,
they should be able to see who they have partnered with, and who they haven't.


Quote from a totally real and not fake person: "With new Buddy(), I dont have to worry about finding a new 
person in the mass of possible candidates here at Hack Reactor. Its as simple as open, browse, and select!
Now we can spend more time learning to code and less time finding someone to code with."
